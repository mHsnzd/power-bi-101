## Power BI
Power BI is a business intelligence service to gather, analyze, and visualize data. Power BI is used for managing, organizing, and utilizing large quantities of data to make data-driven decisions.<br>
Power BI offers many features and tools such as: private dashboard to store data, data retrieval from various sources, data visualization, modeling data, cloud storage. <br>
Power BI is available in two versions: Desktop for smaller businesses and free of charge, Service for bigger businesses offering cloud storage.

Before starting with Power BI, a quick overview of business intelligence is necessary.

### Business Intelligence
Business intelligence can be referred to as a collection of methodologies, tools, processes, and technologies used to improve performance, reduce costs and time, and make better decisions in different sections of a business.
<br>
Business intelligence goes beyond simple reporting, and gathers patterns between data from sources that wouldn't normally be put together.
<br>
Challenges that arise when using business intellegence tools are largely due to poor data quality, poor training, poor data governing techniques, not using self-service Bi, not using correct ETL methods, not using correct storage such as data warehouse.
